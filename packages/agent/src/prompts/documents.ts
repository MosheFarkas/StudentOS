/**
 * The prose parts of the system prompt, as markdown documents.
 *
 * What the agent is told about how to behave used to be string literals inside
 * buildSystemPrompt. That is a poor home for prose: it is hard to read at the
 * width a TypeScript literal allows, it turns a change of voice into a code
 * diff, and it puts the agent's manners in the same file as its tool loop.
 * These are documents, so they live as documents, and rewriting how the agent
 * talks is an edit to one file that a non-programmer can make.
 *
 * The frontmatter follows Anthropic's SKILL.md convention -- a name and a
 * description and nothing else. For the three documents that are skills
 * (see skills/builtin.ts) the description is exactly what the model reads: it
 * says when to load the body, and the body arrives only when the model asks
 * skill_load for it. So a skill's description is a trigger, not a summary.
 *
 * For the rest, the description never reaches the model. It is there for
 * whoever opens the file next.
 *
 * Two things to know before adding a document here. It is read once, at module
 * load, so the process refuses to start rather than quietly serving a turn
 * with half its instructions. And where the body is placed in buildSystemPrompt
 * decides whether it can be cached: these are static, so they belong in the
 * prefix, above anything that changes between turns.

 * copied into it -- a bundler will not follow a readFileSync.
