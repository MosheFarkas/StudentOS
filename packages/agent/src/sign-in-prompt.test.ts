/**
 * The agent declining is not a crash, so nothing else catches it. A student
 * asking their agent to log into a site and being told it cannot handle
 * passwords reads as the product being broken, and it is the answer a model
 * reaches for by default.
 *
 * Two places now. What has to be true before the model has loaded anything
 * stays in the prompt for everyone; how to actually do it is the browser
 * skill, loaded when a site comes up.
