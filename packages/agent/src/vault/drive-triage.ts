/**
 * Deciding about every file in a Drive, not only the ones in a course folder.
 *
 * A student who connects Drive has handed over the whole of it -- full read
 * access comes with the connection -- and a folder that names a course places
 * only a fraction of what is there. The rest used to be thrown away unread: a
 * CAS brainstorming document, an application, revision with no folder, along
 * with the photographs and the music the rule was written to keep out.
 *
 * So the rest is judged, on what the listing says about each file: its name,
 * what kind of thing it is, whose it is, where it sits, when it last changed.
 * Fifty at a time, against the student's courses and what is known about
 * their school, so "CAS" means something. Reading a file to decide about it
 * would be a model call per file for the whole Drive; the listing is enough
 * to tell a study guide from a holiday album, and what stays is read anyway
 * by the pass that writes its sentence.
 *
 * A verdict is kept. A file is asked about once, and again only when it has
 * changed -- otherwise a Drive of five hundred files is ten model calls on
 * every refresh for ever, to reach the same answers.
