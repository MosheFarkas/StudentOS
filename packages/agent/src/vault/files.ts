/**
 * Reading what is actually inside the files.
 *
 * The vault already knows a worksheet exists, which course it belongs to and
 * which assignment it was attached to. It knows nothing about what it says --
 * so a student asking what they need for the titration writeup is told that a
 * file called "Titration method.pdf" exists, which they could see themselves.
 *
 * This is the expensive half of the whole bootstrap: text extraction is free,
 * but turning a two thousand word document into a sentence worth keeping is a
 * model call per file, and a real account has hundreds of files.
 *
 * So the design is entirely about spending that once. A file is read once and
 * never again. A file that cannot be read is recorded as such, or every run
 * for the rest of the year tries the same unreadable hundred. And a limit
 * means the bill is paid over many small runs rather than one large one --
 * which also makes it interruptible, since whatever was written stays written.
 *
 * The containment is the same as the mail pass, and for the same reason: this
 * is prose somebody else wrote. The pass has no tools, its answer is parsed
 * against a schema, and what it produces lands in a note whose source is not
 * the student, so every later reader sees it inside the warning.
