 * and between them those know a great deal about what this student does and
 * nearly nothing about the place they do it. A vault can name a teacher and
 * quote what they set, and cannot say when term ends, what the grades mean, or
 * what kind of school this is. None of that is in anybody's mailbox.
 *
 * So this pass researches, which nothing else in this product does. Three
 * calls: read the vault to work out what to ask, search the web to answer it,
 * then write the page from what came back. Only the middle one reaches the
 * network, because searches are billed one at a time and the other two have
 * nothing to look up.
 *
 * Written deliberately rather than on a schedule. A school's calendar does not
 * change between Tuesdays, and this is the most expensive thing here.
