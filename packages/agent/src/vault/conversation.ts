/**
 * Putting the student's own words on the same timeline as their school.
 *
 * Without this the vault is two stores pretending to be one: Classroom and the
 * inbox on disk, everything the student ever said in Postgres, and no link
 * between them. The question the vault exists to answer -- Classroom says
 * Friday, the teacher emailed that it moved, and the student said they had not
 * started -- is two thirds of an answer until their side is a node too.
 *
 * Unlike mail, this is not somebody else's text. It is the student's own, so
 * the episode is `source: student` and renders without the warning that wraps
 * anything a stranger wrote. That distinction is the whole reason `source`
 * exists on a note.
