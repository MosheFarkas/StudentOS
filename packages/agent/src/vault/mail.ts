/**
 * Turning school mail into ContextoVault episodes.
 *
 * The only part of the bootstrap that needs a model. Classroom arrives as
 * objects with ids; mail arrives as prose somebody else wrote, and deciding
 * what a message means is judgement rather than mapping.
 *
 * What an episode is, and when one is worth making, is defined once in
 * prompts/vault-writing.md rather than restated here. That document is the
 * system prompt for this pass and for every other pass that writes into the
 * vault, so the rules cannot drift between them.
 *
 * The containment is structural rather than a matter of asking nicely:
 *
 *   The pass runs with no tools. A hijacked model has nothing to call, so the
 *   worst outcome available to a hostile message is a wrong sentence in a
 *   note -- visible in the memory panel and deletable by the student.
 *
 *   Its answer is parsed against a schema. Free text is confined to one
 *   summary field with a length cap, so instructions cannot ride out through a
 *   shape that was meant to carry a name.
 *
 *   Links may only point at notes that already exist. It cannot invent a
 *   target, so an edge always lands somewhere real.
