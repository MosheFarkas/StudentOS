 * to tell each of them separately that they read on a phone and cannot take
 * long answers. This page belongs to the student. Said once, known everywhere.
 *
 * Rewritten whole rather than appended to, because a bounded page is what
 * forces the decision about what to drop -- and a page that only grows ends up
 * describing somebody who was dreading a presentation last March.
 *
 * Runs in the background after a conversation has gone quiet, not during one.
 * A pass judging a conversation that is still happening judges half of it, and
 * the cost lands on a student waiting for a reply.
