 * a summary of it: "give me some recipes for potatoes because I have a lot of
 * potatoes" told a student nothing at a glance that "Potato recipes" does not
 * tell them faster.
 *
 * Written from the question rather than from the exchange, and that is a
 * departure from how the big chat products do it -- they wait for the first
 * reply. The reason is latency: this runs beside the turn rather than after
 * it, so it costs the student nothing, and what a conversation is about is
 * almost always settled by the question. Waiting for the answer would buy a
 * marginally better title at the price of the first reply arriving later.
