/**
 * Build the tool set for one student, from the scopes they actually granted.
 *
 * Per-tool rather than per-group, because school admins grant scope subsets
 * routinely. A student whose admin approved course listing but not coursework
 * should get the course tool and simply not have the other -- not a dead
 * integration, and not a tool that 403s every time the model reaches for it.
 *
 * Two reasons this gating matters beyond correctness: every tool definition
 * costs context on every single turn, and a model handed a tool it cannot use
 * will call it, waste a turn discovering that, and apologise -- which reads as
 * the product being broken rather than not fully approved.
 *
 * Tools still check availability defensively; a scope can be revoked between
 * the registry being built and the tool being called.
 */

 * An integration a student can switch off.

 * Once this was also 'gmail:write', the write half on its own. Sending now
 * follows Gmail and turning work in follows Classroom, so a key of that
