/**
 * Opening one of the documents written about a student.
 *
 * The counterpart to vault_search, and deliberately a separate tool. Search is
 * how you get at the evidence: thousands of notes, ranked on words, a handful
 * returned. This is how you get at what was written from it -- a page per
 * class, one about the school, one about what they have told us -- which are
 * not searched for but named.
 *
 * There is no list mode, because there is no need for one. The document the
 * agent is already carrying names the others in [[double brackets]], so the
 * index arrives free on every turn. A wrong name answers with what exists,
 * which covers the rest. Naming them in this description instead would make it
 * differ per student, and the tool definitions are part of the cached prefix.
