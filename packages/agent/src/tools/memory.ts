 * Looking things up in the agent's own history.

 * sits in a cached prefix. Shrinking the window is therefore the cheapest
 * saving available, but shrinking it alone would just make the agent forget
 * things a student told it last week.
 *
 * This is the other half of that trade. The window covers continuity; this
 * covers recall, on demand, and costs nothing on turns that do not need it.
