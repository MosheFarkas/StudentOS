 * There are now two, and they overlap. memory_search reads the raw exchanges
 * in Postgres; vault_search reads ContextoVault, which since conversations
 * became episodes holds a summarised, linked version of some of the same
 * material. That duplication was introduced deliberately -- the raw log and
 * the linked graph answer different questions -- but nothing has ever checked
 * whether the agent can tell which is which, and a real turn was observed
 * calling both for one question.
 *
 * Scored on two things, because only one of them is correctness. Did it answer,
 * and how many tools did it spend doing it. An agent that calls everything
 * every time is right and slow, and slow is a thing a student feels.
