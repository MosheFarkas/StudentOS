 * Scenarios that only a memory can answer.

 * Each history is long enough that the fact being asked about has fallen out
 * of the eight-exchange recency window. That is the point: these measure
 * whether anything rescues a fact the window has dropped, which today means
 * memory_search and nothing else.
 *
 * The filler is deliberately ordinary school chatter rather than padding. A
 * window full of obviously irrelevant text is an easier problem than a window
 * full of plausible near-misses, and the easier problem is not the one a real
 * student produces.
