/**
 * Launching and holding a browser the student is logged into.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything in this file.
 *
 * 1. THE STUDENT LOGS IN TO A BROWSER WE ARE NOT DRIVING. Measured on Chrome
 *    151: `--remote-debugging-pipe` sets `navigator.webdriver = true`, while
 *    `--remote-debugging-port` leaves it false. That looks like an argument for
 *    the port, but the port is an unauthenticated TCP listener that ANY local
 *    process can connect to and use to drive a student's authenticated school
 *    portal. That exact class of hole is how researchers took over Claude's own
 *    Chrome extension in March 2026.
 *
 *    So we refuse the choice. `mode: 'login'` launches with no debugging
 *    transport at all -- an entirely ordinary browser with nothing to detect,
 *    which matters because Google answers automation signals on its sign-in
 *    page with "This browser or app may not be secure." Once the student has
 *    authenticated, `mode: 'drive'` reopens the same profile over the pipe to
 *    read data. Pages behind a login do not re-run those checks, so we never
 *    have to spoof a signal to get past one.
 *
 * 2. A DEDICATED PROFILE, NEVER THE DEFAULT ONE. Since Chrome 136, remote
 *    debugging is refused outright on the default profile, specifically to stop
 *    cookie theft. That restriction is load-bearing for us rather than an
 *    obstacle: it means this code physically cannot reach the student's real
 *    Chrome, where they are signed into Gmail, Drive and Classroom. Those stay
 *    behind OAuth, where the scope model in packages/agent governs them. This
 *    profile only ever holds a school-portal session.
