 * The files that went with a message, above it.

 * Above rather than below, and outside the bubble rather than in it, because
 * that is the order they were made in: the picture was attached, then the
 * question was asked about it.
 *
 * A `local` preview is used when there is one. That is the object URL of the
 * file still in the browser, and it is what makes a sent message appear
 * complete the instant it is sent rather than a moment later when the server
 * has a copy to serve.
 *
 * Keyed by filename rather than by note name, deliberately. The note name is
 * a slug the server derives, and keying on it would mean reimplementing that
 * derivation in the browser and keeping the two in step for ever. The
 * filename is what both ends already agree on.
