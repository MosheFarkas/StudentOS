 * The one question worth stopping for.
 *
 * Deleting a chat takes its transcript and its memories with it, and nothing
 * brings them back -- so this is a dialog rather than an undo, which is the
 * right way round only because there is no undo to offer.
 *
 * Rendered through a portal into the body rather than where it is written.
 * The rail becomes a drawer under 900px and gets a transform to slide it, and
 * a transformed ancestor makes itself the containing block for anything
 * `position: fixed` inside it -- so on a phone this dialog would be positioned
 * against the drawer and clipped to it rather than covering the screen.
